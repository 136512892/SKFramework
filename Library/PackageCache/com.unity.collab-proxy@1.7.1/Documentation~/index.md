# About Version Control

The Version Control package provides an in-editor interface for teams to work with Collaborate and Plastic SCM.

## Collaborate

Collaborate makes it easy for teams to save, share, and sync their Unity projects with others, regardless of location. It's cloud-enabled and built directly into Unity. Please refer to the [Unity Collaborate Manual.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityCollaborate.html)

## Plastic SCM

Plastic SCM Plugin for Unity (beta) is a free Unity plugin that gives you the ability to use Plastic SCM, a leading version control solution, directly in Unity. It is currently available on the Unity Asset Store but will be moving to this package in an upcoming release.
