**What is the pricing for Plastic SCM Cloud Edition?**

The pricing for Plastic SCM Cloud Edition depends on the number of users and amount of storage. It does not have a limit on bandwidth (except in cases of excessive use of egress).

* As your team grows, the 3 first users will remain free. For a team of 5 users, you pay for 2 users.
* Storage depends on the size of your repositories. For more details, see [Plastic SCM Cloud Edition pricing](https://www.plasticscm.com/plasticscm-cloud-edition/pricing).
