You have changes pending that need to be checked in into your workspace. It is recommended that you checkin prior to merge to avoid possible issues undoing merges. 
If you are familiar with merge, you can change this behavior by going to Preferences / Diff and merge / Allow to merge with pending changes. 

Note: We changed this behavior to avoid issues for new users, although it is not hazardous to enable it if you are familiar with how merge works.

There are pending changes in your workspace.

 You can continue with the switch operation or cancel the switch and open a Pending Changes view, so that you can checkin (or undo) the pending changes. Then, you can run the "{0}" command again. 

If you continue with the switch operation, your local changes won't be lost, and will still appear as pending changes after the switch operation.

== SwitchToLabelExplanation ==
There are pending changes in your workspace.

You can continue with the switch operation or cancel the switch and open a Pending Changes view, so that you can checkin (or undo) the pending changes. Then, you can run the "Switch workspace to this label" command again.

If you continue with the switch operation, your local changes won't be lost, and will still appear as pending changes after the switch operation. But, you won't be able to submit these changes, because a label configuration is a read-only configuration. 

To modify a labeled configuration, create a branch, setting the label as the branch base. Then, switch the workspace to that branch and make changes as usual.

== NewCertificateTitle ==
Server SSL certificate is not in the store

== NewCertificateMessage ==
The server you are connecting to has sent a certificate which is not in the store. This is normal if it is the first time connecting to this server. 

            Certificate details:
            - Issued to: {0}
            - Issued by: {1}
            - Expiration date: {3}
            - Certificate hash: {5}

            If you trust this host, click "Yes" to add the key to the Plastic SCM key store (recommended if it is the first time connecting to this server). 
            If you want to carry on connecting just once, without adding the key to the store, click "No". 
            If you do not trust this host, click "Cancel" to abandon the connection.

== ExistingCertificateChangedTitle ==
Server certificate has changed!

== ExistingCertificateChangedMessage ==
WARNING: This host certificate does NOT match the one you have in the key store. It may mean that the server identity has been compromised or a man-in-the-middle attack is being performed on you. 

            Certificate details:
            - Issued to: {0}
            - Issued by: {1}
            - Expiration date: {3}
            - Certificate hash: {5}

            If you were expecting this change and trust the new certificate, click "Yes" to add the key to the Plastic SCM key store and trust this certificate in the future. 
            If you want to carry on connecting just once, without adding the key to the store, click "No". 
            If you want to abandon this connection, click "Cancel". This is the ONLY guaranteed safe choice.

== InvalidCertificateHostnameTitle ==
Hostname mismatch in secure connection

== InvalidCertificateHostnameMessage ==
WARNING: The hostname provided in the server certificate does NOT match the server hostname. This means that the certificate was not issued to this hostname or that there is a network configuration problem with this host. 

            - Certificate hostname: {0}
            - Server hostname: {1}

            If you want to continue connecting to this host, click "Yes". The certificate validation will continue (not recommended). 
            If you want to abandon the connection, click "No" (recommended).

== EncryptionConfigurationEnterPassword ==
Enter a password to generate the encryption key:

== EncryptionConfigurationRemarks ==
Remarks:
            * Be very careful with the encryption password; it's the only way to decrypt your data on server '{0}'.
            * If you're decrypting data and you enter a wrong password, the data will fail to decrypt and you will have to edit cryptedservers.conf on your client to fix it.
            * Be careful to use the same password (encryption key) company-wide to work with '{0}'. Otherwise, data will be encrypted differently in each client.

== PendingChangesWhatToShowDialogTitle ==
Configure the types of changes to display

== PendingChangesWhatToShowDialogExplanation ==
From auto-refresh to deciding if you want to see private files, ignored and more

== PendingChangesMoveDetectionDialogTitle ==
Configure how Plastic finds moved files and directories in your workspace

== PendingChangesMoveDetectionDialogExplanation ==
It can detect files and directories that you moved or renamed on disk

== PendingChangesAdvancedMoveDetectionDialogTitle ==
Boost change detection using the NTFS journal

== PendingChangesAdvancedMoveDetectionDialogExplanation ==
It is an advanced feature helpful to perform complex refactors, but use with care

== PendingChangesFilesystemWatcherEnabled ==
File system watcher is enabled

== PendingChangesFilesystemWatcherDisabled ==
File system watcher is disabled

== PendingChangesFilesystemWatcherEnabledExplanation ==
Plastic watches the workspace for changes to make the operation faster. This removes the need to walk the directory structure, although move matching can still consume time.

== PendingChangesFilesystemWatcherDisabledExplanation ==
This is not normal and can affect performance. Plastic watches the workspace for changes using the Windows API. This way it doesn't need to walk the directory structure. If it is disabled, the operation can be much slower. Contact support for help unless it was disabled in client.conf intentionally. [[HELP_URL|{0}]]

== PendingChangesShowCheckouts ==
Show checkouts

== PendingChangesShowCheckoutsExplanation ==
Shows files that you explicitly checkedout in Plastic. Also, files that you moved using Plastic GUIs or command line. And finally, files involved in a merge in progress.
Checkouts display super-fast because they are on a list; no need to walk the directory structure to find them.
Tip: With a workspace larger than 800k files, it may make sense to use only checkouts for faster operation. Checkouts are also needed if you use file locks.

== PendingChangesFindChanged ==
Find changed files in the workspace

== PendingChangesFindChangedExplanation ==
Walks the workspace directory structure to find changed files (timestamp changed).

== PendingChangesCheckFileContent ==
Check the content to determine files as changed, not just timestamp

== PendingChangesCheckFileContentExplanation ==
When the timestamp of a file is modified, calculate the hash with the previous before setting it as changed. Useful with applications that save files without performing any changes. Warning: It can make "pending changes" slower because it requires reading and hashing files.

== PendingChangesAutoRefresh ==
Auto-refresh

== PendingChangesAutoRefreshExplanation ==
Let Plastic refresh the Pending Changes list as needed to avoid manual refreshing.

== PendingChangesGroupInChangeLists ==
Group changes in "change lists"

== PendingChangesGroupInChangeListsExplanation ==
Plastic can group the changes in the workspace in user created lists. This is useful if you miss the feature from previous version control.

== PendingChangesShowPrivateFiles ==
Show private files

== PendingChangesShowPrivateFilesExplanation ==
List files that are not under source control. They can be recently added files, but sometimes are tool-generated content that you want to ignore. (Adding to "ignored" can be a better option.)

== PendingChangesAlwaysSelectPrivateFiles ==
Always select private files

== PendingChangesAlwaysSelectPrivateFilesExplanation ==
This way you won't forget new files on checkin. But you need to have a good ignore.conf to avoid adding temporary files to version control.

== PendingChangesShowIgnoredFiles ==
Show ignored files

== PendingChangesShowIgnoredFilesExplanation ==
Show files that you previously ignored by adding them to ignore.conf.

== PendingChangesShowHiddenFiles ==
Show hidden files

== PendingChangesShowHiddenFilesExplanation ==
Show files that you previously hid by adding them to hidden_changes.conf.

== PendingChangesShowDeletedFiles ==
Show deleted files and directories

== PendingChangesShowDeletedFilesExplanation ==
Show files that you deleted manually in the workspace outside of Plastic control. (Not using a GUI or a command, but simply deleting them from disk.)

== PendingChangesMoveDetectionExplanation ==
You can tell Plastic that you moved a file using "cm mv" or moving files from the GUIs or IDE integrations. This method doesn't require "detection". But, if you move files directly on disk, Plastic can still detect the operation. It applies to directories too.

== PendingChangesFindMovedFiles ==
Find moved and renamed files and directories

== PendingChangesFindMovedFilesExplanation ==
Walks the workspace finding possible moves. For example, if you rename foo.c to bar.c, Plastic will find bar.c as added, foo.c as deleted, and it will try to match them. It can be slow if you have lots of private files.

== PendingChangesMoveDetectionFineTune ==
You can fine tune how "find moves" works:

== PendingChangesMatchBinarySameExtension ==
Match binary files only when they have the same extension

== PendingChangesMatchBinarySameExtensionExplanation ==
Doesn't try to match a .png with a .jpg. But it won't find a .doc to .docx rename.

== PendingChangesMatchTextSameExtension ==
Match text files only when they have the same extension

== PendingChangesMatchTextSameExtensionExplanation ==
Doesn't try to match a .cs with a .c. It can be useful in some circumstances.

== PendingChangesSimilarityPercentage ==
Similarity percentage

== PendingChangesSimilarityPercentageExplanation ==
Defines "how similar" the comparison needs to be for two files to be detected as moved or renamed. For example, if you move foo.c to bar.c and modify it later, the % defines how similar they need to be so that Plastic considers them the same file.
It applies to directories too: how similar the directory structure needs to be: how many moved children relative to the total of directory entries.
For binaries, the % means the allowed difference in size.

== PendingChangesEnableNTFSJournal ==
Enable precise tracking using the NTFS journal

== PendingChangesEnableNTFSJournalExplanation ==
Use the NTFS journal to detect moved files and directories while the GUI is open. It is super precise and there is no "guessing" or heuristic. NTFS knows when a file or directory is moved.

But, there is a drawback. It is not safe to use it if you refactor your project with tools like Visual Studio. This is because VS doesn't simply move foo.c to src/bar.c, but, creates a new src/bar.c, copies the content, and then deletes foo.c. There is no way to track it from the filesystem.

If you plan to do a big refactor using the Windows Explorer or the command line, it will work smoothly.

== PendingChangesChangeTrackerServiceNotRunning ==
Plastic Change Tracker service is not running

== PendingChangesChangeTrackerServiceNotRunningExplanation ==
Cannot communicate with the Plastic Change Tracker service. Ensure that it is installed and running.

== PendingChangesINotifyEnabled ==
inotify change watcher is enabled

== PendingChangesINotifyDisabled ==
inotify change watcher is disabled

== PendingChangesINotifyEnabledExplanation ==
Plastic watches the workspace for changes to make the operation faster. This removes the need to walk the directory structure, although move matching can still consume time. Plastic takes advantage of inotify, but it needs some tuning to work correctly. Check: {0}

== PendingChangesINotifyDisabledExplanation ==
Pending changes performance improves greatly when it can take advantage of the inotify-based detection system. Check the following instructions to enable it: {0} and restart the GUI

== MergeToMergeNeededExplanation ==
While the merge-to operation was running, new changesets were created in the destination of the merge-to operation, creating more than one head. Consider unifying them by running a new merge (or merge-to) operation. Affected branches:

== MergeToMergeNeededBranch ==
{0}@{1}@{2} (mount '{3}')

== MergeToNeededQuestion ==
A new changeset has been created at branch {0}@{1}@{2} (mount '{3}') during the merge-to operation. You need to merge again to complete the operation. Do you want to merge again now?

== RuntimeVersionErrorFilesystemWatcher ==
Plastic SCM: Detected an unsupported Runtime Version. The Plastic SCM Filesystem Watcher is not compatible with this runtime, and has been disabled.This can affect to the Pending Changes view performance, and also causes that the auto - refresh feature for views is disabled. We strongly recommend upgrading to the.NET 4.x equivalent Runtime Version for a better experience. In order to change the Runtime Version go Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Configuration > Scripting Runtime Version.
